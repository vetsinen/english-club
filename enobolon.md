**Wednesday's English@Obolon**

Meetings are FREE of charge! We meet EVERY Wednesday and Friday!

NO REGISTRATION is required. ALL LEVELS are welcome. Just be active and ready to speak.

We meet in Dreamtown #2 (beetween Minska and Heroiv Dnipra). 

To find us, you need to enter the mall's entrance that is closest to the Minska subway station. After you're inside take the upstairs/elevator on your left and then turn right. Go straight ahead, leaving the furniture store behind. There you will see a food cort in front of McFoxy. Usually, we occupy a wooden table near a fake fence. 
Looking forward to see you.
