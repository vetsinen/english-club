The idea of game is inspired by classical mafia game

Two teams participate in the game: unemployed and company. There are a set of roles
* team-leads
* HR
* candidates
* workers
* n00b(s)
* Zuckerberg (optional)
 
**team-leads** and **HR** always plays in company team. their aim as in real life is to to form a good team for development of very cool software. at the beginning of the game are declared minimum skills requirements for team which are essential to start development. for example: 1 general dev, 1 java dev, 1 qa with selenium. when they hire people with all these skills this team won. all candidates who become workers also win.

Candidate becomes worker if selected by teamleads in the night by secret voting, which is similar to classical mafia selection. Teamleads can skip chance to hire if they are not sure. If person is selected he/she changes role and became worker. skills added to company team and if they are satisfied - company win. The key problem of teamleads - they don't have reliable info about skills of another players. And the biggest danger is n00b, if n00b is hired - company instantly looses

power of HR - he/she can check skills of players and detect n00b (this role can be similar to policeman in classical mafia). but teamleads in game don't know who is HR, also HR don't know teamleads. everybody can pretend as HR or teamlead etc. in the night ask moderator about skill of some player. if skill is apsent - the answer is no, if player is n00b - moderator shows 0. during the day HR tries to understand who are teamleads and bring them info about employees
n00b always plays in candidates team, the only chance to win - is to be hired by company. if hired - company looses - n00b and unemployed win

candidates have two strategies to win: be hired by company and became workers or propagate n00b into company 
Zuckerberg in the beginning is also unemployed but with special power - if hired by company - company instantly wins

the primary aim of game is to practice your language skills so take this to your mind. it's strongly recommended to PLAY your ROLE not yourself. try to forget who you are in real life and be your role. recommended for each game accept new nicknames. Nicknames equal or similar to title of roles are forbidden. you can't take nickname Zuckerberg or n00b
